    <h2>Getting started</h2>

    <p>
        First, you need to create a copy of Byte Buddy on your local machine. Simply clone Byte Buddy's repository
        by using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> or by cloning it directly on
        <a href="https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy">GitHub</a>. Once the repository was cloned, you can build 
        the project using <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>. From your shell, this might look something 
        like this:
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
git clone https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy.git
cd bcd byte-buddy
mvn package
</pre>

    <p>
        Before you start to code, make sure that all test cases run successfully. This should be the case at all times
        for the <a href="https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/tree/master"><code>master</code></a> branch of Byte Buddy.
        This is hopefully confirmed by our current <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> build which currently is
        <a href="https://travis-ci.org/raphw/byte-buddy" class="social-link">
            <img style="max-width:100%;"
                 data-canonical-src="https://travis-ci.org/raphw/byte-buddy.svg"
                 alt="Byte Buddy build status"
                 src="https://travis-ci.org/raphw/byte-buddy.svg?branch=master">
        </a>
        and which is constantly monitoring Byte Buddy's latest state. Travis is configured to compile and test the
        project for the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">Open JDK</a> versions 6 and 7 and the
        <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html">Oracle JDK</a> versions
        7 and 8. Since some of our tests are creating and loading Java classes, we make sure that the generated classes
        do not use a format that cannot be understood by a specific Java version. If you are making changes to Byte
        Buddy that directly affect the generated byte code, please make sure to sufficiently test your build using
        different Java versions before committing your changes. All this implies that you need to write Java code that
        is compatible to a Java 6 compiler. As a general rule, your code should come with a minimum test coverage of
        90 percent but we prefer thorough tests over tests that only attempt to hit any line. You can always run
        Maven's <code>cobertura:cobertura</code> goal for creating a report on your code's test coverage. Byte Buddy's
        current test coverage is at
        <a href="https://coveralls.io/r/raphw/byte-buddy?branch=master" class="social-link">
            <img src="http://img.shields.io/coveralls/raphw/byte-buddy/master.svg" alt="Byte Buddy code coverage"/>
        </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project is organized in different modules. The root project <code>byte-buddy-parent</code> serves as a
        common ground for the configuration of any Byte Buddy module. The project's implementation is found
        in the <code>byte-buddy-dev</code> module. This module is configured to rely on a direct dependency onto the
        <a href="http://asm.ow2.org/">ASM</a> library, thus the <i>dev</i> qualifier in the module's name. Because the
        ASM library does <a href="http://asm.ow2.org/doc/faq.html#Q15">not guarantee to respect
        backwards-compatibility</a>, the <code>byte-buddy</code> module repackages the ASM-dependency into Byte Buddy's
        own name space. In doing so, the ASM dependency is moved to <code>net.bytebuddy.jar.asm</code>. This
        dependency-free module does not define sources of its own but relies on the <code>byte-buddy-dev</code> module.
        On its build, all dependencies are resolved and a dependency-free deployment descriptor is created. Further
        information can be found in the section on <a href="#/dependency">how to define a dependency onto Byte Buddy</a>.
        In order to activate this repacking, you need to run the Maven build using the <code>extras</code> profile which
        will furthermore cause the creation of artifacts for source code and javadoc. Additionally, Maven attempts to
        sign all artifacts if this profile is set such that
        <a href="http://blog.sonatype.com/2010/01/how-to-generate-pgp-signatures-with-maven/">the gpg plugin must be
            configured correctly</a>. As another module, <code>byte-buddy-benchmark</code> contains a
        <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">JMH</a> benchmark for measuring Byte Buddy's runtime
        behavior compared to other code generation libraries. The <code>byte-buddy-agent</code> module supplies a
        Java agent that allows to enhance Byte Buddy's general API. The <code>byte-buddy-android</code> module
        contains a <code>ClassLoadingStrategy</code> that functions on the Android platform where
        <code>byte-buddy-android-test</code> defines a test application to apply this strategy. It is only built
        when the <code>android</code> profile is used as it requires an Android SDK to run.

    <h2>Contribute</h2>

    <p>
        When you have fixed a bug, simply create a <a href="https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/pulls">pull request</a>
        on GitHub. We will look into the matter as quickly as possible, once we receive the notification. Make however
        sure that you have accurately described your changes and the fixed issue and please provide a test case that
        reproduces the problem and proves that your fix is working. This makes our work much easier and we will be able
        to apply your patch much quicker. If you add new methods, fields or types, make sure to write some in-code
        documentation that describes their purpose. If you apply performance-relevant changes, please self-critically
        reflect those changes using the <code>byte-buddy-benchmark</code> suite. Finally, please note that new releases
        of Byte Buddy are normally developed in their own branch.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are contributing a feature, please <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/byte-buddy">get in
        touch</a> before spending a lot of time with it such that we can discuss how your changes are meaningful at
        Byte Buddy's current development state. Byte Buddy is meant to steadily provide more functionality but we do
        not grow its feature set on the expense of its stability and code consistency. However, do not be discouraged
        by this announcement. If you got deep enough into Byte Buddy's source to being able to implement a new awesome
        feature that you want to share, you did for sure give it some thought and we will do our best to merge it into
        our build! Simply come talk to us and we are more than happy to welcome you on board.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you feel like contributing to Byte Buddy's documentation, to its description on this web page or even to the
        structure and design of this web page, you are absolutely welcome to do so! We deeply believe that a thorough
        and up-to-date documentation is the key to a successful project and we will do our best to live up to this
        conviction. Even minor changes are welcome as long as they improve Byte Buddy's accessibility or appearance,
        because in the end, this project was made for its users. Simply clone this web page which is hosted on GitHub
        in the project's <a href="https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/tree/gh-pages"><code>gh-pages</code></a> branch.

    <h2>Roadmap</h2>

    <p>
        Currently, there are several enhancements planned for future releases. A version 1.0 will be released once all
        the following features are implemented and tested to be stable:
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>0.6</dt>
        <dd>
            Better support for generics: In this version, generic types should be written to created class files as
            it is often used by frameworks that read out this metadata. Additionally, the API is extended to allow the
            definition of additional generic parameters when defining new types, methods or fields.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        Additionally, there is a plan to expose some additional information on types, methods and fields by their
        descriptions which are optional and only available when parsing a class file using a <code>TypePool</code>.
